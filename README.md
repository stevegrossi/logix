# Logix

Tools for parsing and working with propositional logic.

## Examples

### Evaluating propositions with given truth values

```elixir
Logix.evaluate("A^B", %{"A" => true, "B" => true})
#=> true

Logix.evaluate("A^B", %{"A" => true, "B" => false})
#=> false
```

### Detecting tautologies and contraditions

```elixir
Logix.tautology?("(A->B)<->(Bv~A)")
#=> true

Logix.tautology?("A->B")
#=> false

Logix.contradtion?("A^~A")
#=> true

Logix.contradtion?("A->B")
#=> false
```

### Detecting Logical Equivalence

```elixir
Logix.equivalent?("A->B", "~B->~A")
#=> true

Logix.equivalent?("A->B", "AvB")
#=> false
```

### Generating Proofs from Assumptions

```elixir
Logix.prove(["A", "BvC", "B->D", "C->D"], "A^D")
#=> {:ok,
#=>   %{
#=>     1 => {"A", :premise},
#=>     2 => {"BvC", :premise},
#=>     3 => {"B->D", :premise},
#=>     4 => {"C->D", :premise},
#=>     5 => {"D", {:disjunction_elimination, [2, 3, 4]}},
#=>     6 => {"A^D", {:conjunction_introduction, [1, 5]}}
#=>   }}

Logix.prove(["A"], "B")
#=> {:error, :proof_failed}
```

### Proving Tautologies from No Assumptions

```elixir
Logix.prove("B->(A->B)")
#=> {:ok,
#=> %{
#=>   1 => {"B", :assumption},
#=>   2 => {"A", :assumption},
#=>   3 => {"A->B", {:implication_introduction, [1, 2]}},
#=>   4 => {"B->(A->B)", {:implication_introduction, [1, 3]}}
#=> }}
```

### The Rules of Logical Inference

#### Implication Introduction

If you assume "X" and then prove "Y", you can now use "X -> Y" outside of the assumption's scope.

#### Implication Elimination

If you have "X" and you have "X -> Y", then you're entitled to "Y".

#### Disjunction Introduction

If you have "X", then you're entitled to "X v Y".

#### Disjunction Elimination

If you have "X v Y", "X -> Z", and "Y -> Z", then you're entitled to Z.

#### Conjunction Introduction

If you have "X" and you have "Y", you're entitled to "X ^ Y"

#### Conjunction Elimination

If you have "X ^ Y", then you're entitled to both "X" and "Y".

#### Biconditional Introduction

If you have "X -> Y" and also "Y -> X", then you're entitled to "X <-> Y".

#### Biconditional Elimination

If you have "X <-> Y" and you have "X", then you're entitled to "Y", and if you have "Y" then you're entitled to "X".

#### Negation Introduction

This rule requires you to prove something within the scope of an assumption. If you assume "X" and you can prove both "Y" and "~Y", then you're entitled to "~X" outside the scope of that assumption.

#### Negation Elimination

Likewise, if you assume "~X" and you can prove both "Y" and "~Y", then you're entitled to "X" outside the scope of that assumption.

### Strategies for Proving Kinds of Statements

- **any**: Negation Elimination, Implication Elimination, Disjunction Elimination, Conjunction Elimination, Biconditional Elimination
- **negation**: Negation Introduction, any
- **disjunction**: Disjunction Introduction, any
- **conjunction**: Conjunction Introduction, any
- **implication**: Implication Introduction, any
- **biconditional**: Biconditional Introduction, any

### TODO
- Implement the semantic function `Proof.valid?` that uses truth tables to check the validity of a proof before trying to prove it?
- [ðŸš§] Implement the proof-by-assumption strategies: implication introduction, negation introduction, and negation elimination
  - all assumptions must be discharged for the proof to be valid. Right now Logix can just assume what it wants to prove and be done. But how to represent assumptions to ensure their fulfillment?
  - In the case of `A->(A^B)`, Logix tries to prove `A^B` by implication elimination, so it first tries to prove the antecedent `A`, sees it in `A^B` and tries to prove it by conjunction elimination, so it tries to prove `A^B` by implication elimination... So we may need to keep track of which line we're trying to prove and not try to prove that line with itself or parts of itself.
- [ ] Could things be simpler if sentences were tagged? e.g. `{:sentence, "A"}` instead of bare strings
- [ ] Use ["gappy truth tables"](https://sites.oxy.edu/traiger/logic/primer/chapter5/gappy.html) to optimize semantic functions, e.g. we need only one invalid row to refute equivalence so we don't need to calculate them all. (Such optimization will be especially noticeable with many variables, since truth table complexity grows exponentially with that.)
- [ ] Graduate to predicate logic ðŸŽ“
